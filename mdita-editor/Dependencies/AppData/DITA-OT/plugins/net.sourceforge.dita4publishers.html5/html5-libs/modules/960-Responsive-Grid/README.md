960-Responsive-Grid
===================

A simple css **add-on** to the popular 960 grid system that comes with adaptive grid defaults for small screens, tablets, and mobile devices. 

The 960 Responsive Grid uses CSS media-queries to do all of the responsive magic. Hopefully this will help people who are looking to make an existing 960 grid site responsive without having to re-do the whole grid system. If you are able to restructure your sites grid there are tons of great systems out there with responsiveness already baked in.

How To Use It
-------------

Assuming you are already using the 960 grid system ([960.gs](http://960.gs)) all you have to do is place `960-responsive.css` somewhere after the original 960 grid css, like so:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="960.css" />
<link rel="stylesheet" href="960-responsive.css" />
```
